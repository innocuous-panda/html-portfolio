<h3>Howls Moving Castle</h3>
<p>This is my favorite animated film. Beautiful animation and great plot!</p>

<h3>Lost in Translation</h3>
<p>I love movies that make me want to cry.</p>

<h3>The Great Gatsby</h3>
<p>The 2013 remake is my favorite! I'd be lying if I told you I didn't cry during the last 10 minutes. </p>
